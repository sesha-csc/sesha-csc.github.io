Skills: R, Object Oriented Programming, R6 Class 

In this project, I simulated the movement of pieces through a monopoly game using a random dice roll. I coded the entire Monoply Board as well as the Chance and Community Decks. In addition, I included the rules for moving through jail, being sent to jail, and leaving jail. It was especially challenging to conisder edge cases. Through running nearly 10,000 simulations of the game, I conducted a Monte Carlo Study to understand which positions get landed on the most in the Game of Monopoly. The entire project was built under the R6 Class system and entailed object oriented programinng to store and update important features of the players throughout the game. From the simulation study, I was able to provide a strategy as to which Monopoly properties are best suited to give you a high return on investment from rent collection.

Skills: R

Through this project, I simulated two players playing a game of Chutes and Ladders. I built the board using graphics in R and arrows to indicate their movement. I also performed a final Monte Carlo Study to understand which ladders and chutes where the most landed on.
