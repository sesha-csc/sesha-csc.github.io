<p>I'm a third year undergraduate student at UCLA pursuing a double B.S. in Statistics and Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing at UCLA. I have a deep interest in statistical modeling and predictive analysis and have worked with the UCLA Psychology Department and with the UCSF Biostatistics Department to apply my skills in research contexts. I'm also a Data Analyst for the Bruin Sports Analytics Group at UCLA, producing predictive models of baseball salary data or analyses of NFL concussion rates.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my free time (free time? what's that?) , you can catch me reading, playing with my dog, Cashew, learning theme songs on the guitar (I'm working on the Better Call Saul theme at the moment), or playing badminton with friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>Data and its infinite potential is so exciting to me and I'm eager for any opportunity to delve deeper into the data world.</p>
