<p>I'm a recent graduate from UCLA with a double B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, and Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing. I'm deeply obsessed with process improvement and finding ways to ask the question, "How can this be better?" </p>
<hr>
<p>Data and its infinite potential is so exciting to me and I'm eager for any opportunity to delve deeper into the data world.</p>
