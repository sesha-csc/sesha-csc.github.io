title: "A little about me"

I'm a third year undergraduate student at UCLA pursuing a double B.S. in Statistics and Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing at UCLA. I have a deep interest in statistical modeling and predictive analysis and have worked with the UCLA Psychology Department and with the UCSF Biostatistics Department to apply my skills in research contexts.

Data and its infinite potential is so exciting to me and I'm eager for any opportunity to delve deeper into the data world.
