<p>I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA pursuing a double B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, and Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing. I have a deep interest in text mining, optimization, and statistical modeling. I hope to apply data science and statistical techniques to a wide variety of my interests including climate science and education. </p>

<p>Data and its infinite potential is so exciting to me and I'm eager for any opportunity to delve deeper into the data world.</p>
