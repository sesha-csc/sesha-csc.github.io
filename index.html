<p>I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA pursuing a double B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, and Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing. I have a deep interest in text mining, optimization, and statistical modeling. I hope to apply data science and statistical techniques to a wide variety of my interests including sports, climate science, and education.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my free time, you can catch me reading, playing with my dog, Cashew, learning theme songs on the guitar (I'm working on the Better Call Saul theme at the moment), or playing badminton with friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>Data and its infinite potential is so exciting to me and I'm eager for any opportunity to delve deeper into the data world.</p>
